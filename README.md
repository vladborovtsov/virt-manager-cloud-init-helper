# Cloud-Init VM Creation Script

This project provides a Bash script for creating virtual machines (VMs) using QEMU/KVM and cloud-init.

## Features

- Interactive creation of VMs.
- Configurable VM settings (RAM, CPUs, image size).
- Supports bridged and open (macvtap) network modes.
- Cloud-init integration for user and SSH setup.

# Project Overview

As of the current version, this script fully satisfies my requirements. There are no immediate plans for new features, as updates will be based on future needs as they arise.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any improvements or ideas, feel free to contribute.



## Prerequisites

- qemu-kvm
- libvirt-daemon-system
- libvirt-clients
- virtinst
- genisoimage
- wget
- bridge-utils (for bridge network mode)
- whois (for `mkpasswd` utility)
- arp-scan (for IP detection in open network mode)

## Usage

1. **Setup `.env` File:**
   Configure environment variables such as VM specs and network settings in `.env`.

2. **Execute the Script:**
   Run the script to interactively create a VM with specified configurations.

3. **Choose Network Mode:**
   Select between 'bridge' or 'open' network modes during script execution.

4. **VM Access:**
   The script provides the VM's IP address at the end for easy access.

## Network Configuration

- **Bridge Mode:** Uses a bridge interface for VM networking.
- **Open Mode:** Uses a macvtap interface, directly connecting the VM to the physical network.
